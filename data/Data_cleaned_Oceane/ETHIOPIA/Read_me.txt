All the coding tables (crop species, areas, quantities) are in the "conversion_files" folder. It is specified each time in the column "complementary_informations" when these documents are needed.

The yellow lines in the metadata file correspond to variables that are not present in all waves (and/or sections for the use data table). It is specified each time in the column "complementary_informations" for which wave(s) or section this information is available.

Concerning the section on uses, "permanent" and "non-permanent" crops were documented in two separate sections for waves 1 to 3 whereas they were documented in the same section for wave 4. As a result, for some households, there are sometimes crops that are found in both sections, which creates repetitions.
